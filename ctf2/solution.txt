challenge: Flask of trouble
category: web
name: v4ndan

To play just use: "docker-compose up"

inside the challenge directory. The webpage will be available on your localhost on port 8000.

solution:
1. The players are presented with a contact form when they start.
2. The admin will read and click all the web urls.
3. But he won't fall for any sort of attack.
4. After the user enters any url (ex burp collaborator) they will receive a get request on that URL as if the admin clicked on it.
5. after inspection of the request headers players will find a new endpoint in the web app.
6. Going to that endpoint won give them much except some social media URLs.
7. Some of them are duds but the twitter one will have the url to someone's profile. proabbly the developer of the website.
8. He has only one tweet which will contain a secret.
9 Players will need to edit the cookie on this webapp (change logged_in to true from false) and then sign it with the secret to finally be presented with the flag.
